# Impelenting A Lasso Interface for the CouchDB API

This library is a set of methods and types designed to facilitate interacting
with CouchDB using the Lasso programming language.

The master branch contains the latest stable release (version 0.1.0) while the
dev branch has the latest development work.


## Installation

For the moment, installation consists of copying the lib and src directories to
the appropriate LassoStartup folder. If you already have http-lasso or the
json_(de/en)code methods, then you can remove them from the LassoStartup folder.
At any rate, the CouchDB connector has been developed against the versions of
these libraries found in the lib folder.
